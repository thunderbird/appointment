# Using Zoom with Thunderbird Appointment

You can optionally connect your [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com/) account to Thunderbird Appointment to generate one-time meeting links after a booking has been confirmed.

## Connecting your Zoom Account

Connecting your Zoom account is simple! Once you're logged in, navigate to [Settings -> Connected Accounts](https://appointment.day/settings/connectedAccounts). From there simply scroll down until you see the Zoom section. Click the `Connect` button, and you'll be sent over to Zoom's authentication flow and be asked to accept or deny permissions to Thunderbird Appointment. 

If you accept the permissions you'll be sent back to Thunderbird Appointment where your account will be connected. You can confirm that you're good-to-go if you see a red `Disconnect` button instead of a `Connect` button. 

## Disconnecting your Zoom Account

If at any-time you want to disconnect your Zoom account you may do the following:

- Click the red `Disconnect` button on [Settings -> Connected Accounts](https://appointment.day/settings/connectedAccounts).
- In Zoom's settings you can remove authorization to Thunderbird Appointment.
- You can delete your Thunderbird Appointment account.

In any of these cases any references to your Zoom account will be removed from Thunderbird Appointment.

## Enabling Meeting Link Generation

Once you've connected your Zoom account you must enable meeting link generation on your schedule. 

Simple navigate to [Dashboard](https://appointment.day/dashboard) and click on the `Meeting Details` tab. Once expanded you should have access to check the `Generate Zoom Meeting` checkbox. Once checked you'll notice the `Video Link` section has been removed as Zoom meeting links will be generated at the time of booking. Finally, click the `Save` button below and you should be good to go!
