# BrowserStack Reporting
# ======================
# The following capabilities are used to set up reporting on BrowserStack:
# Set 'projectName' to the name of your project. Example, Marketing Website
projectName: Thunderbird Appointment
# Set `buildName` as the name of the job / testsuite being run
buildName: Nightly Appointment E2E Tests (Desktop)
# `buildIdentifier` is a unique id to differentiate every execution that gets appended to
# buildName. Choose your buildIdentifier format from the available expressions:
# ${BUILD_NUMBER} (Default): Generates an incremental counter with every execution
# ${DATE_TIME}: Generates a Timestamp with every execution. Eg. 05-Nov-19:30
# Read more about buildIdentifiers here -> https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/selenium/organize-tests
buildIdentifier: '${DATE_TIME}'

# =======================================
# Platforms (Browsers / Devices to test)
# =======================================
# Platforms object contains all the browser / device combinations you want to test on.
# For browser/os versions compatible with our playwright version see https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/playwright/browsers-and-os?fw-lang=nodejs
platforms:
  - os: OS X
    osVersion: Sequoia
    browserName: playwright-firefox
    browserVersion: 139.0
    playwrightConfigOptions:
      name: Firefox-OSX
      setup: 
      - name: 'setup_firefox'
        testMatch: 'auth.desktop.setup.ts'

# =======================
# Parallels per Platform
# =======================
# The number of parallel threads to be used for each platform set.
# BrowserStack's SDK runner will select the best strategy based on the configured value
#
# Example 1 - If you have configured 3 platforms and set `parallelsPerPlatform` as 2, a total of 6 (2 * 3) parallel threads will be used on BrowserStack
#
# Example 2 - If you have configured 1 platform and set `parallelsPerPlatform` as 5, a total of 5 (1 * 5) parallel threads will be used on BrowserStack
parallelsPerPlatform: 1

# ==========================================
# BrowserStack Local
# (For localhost, staging/private websites)
# ==========================================
# Set browserStackLocal to true if your website under test is not accessible publicly over the internet
# Learn more about how BrowserStack Local works here -> https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/selenium/local-testing-introduction
browserstackLocal: false # <boolean> (Default false)
# browserStackLocalOptions:
# Options to be passed to BrowserStack local in-case of advanced configurations
  # localIdentifier: # <string> (Default: null) Needed if you need to run multiple instances of local.
  # forceLocal: true  # <boolean> (Default: false) Set to true if you need to resolve all your traffic via BrowserStack Local tunnel.
  # Entire list of arguments available here -> https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/selenium/manage-incoming-connections

# ===================
# Debugging features
# ===================
debug: false # <boolean> # Set to true if you need screenshots for every selenium command ran
networkLogs: false # <boolean> Set to true to enable HAR logs capturing; off as may contain sensitive info like login API requests
consoleLogs: info # <string> Remote browser's console debug levels to be printed (`disable`, `errors`, `warnings`, `info`, or `verbose`)
framework: playwright
# the e2e tests use the same node.js project so the playwright version dependecy must work on both desktop
# and mobile browsers; and therefore must be the same in all of our browserstack-*.yml config files
# for playwright ver we need one compatible with our desktop and mobile browsers, see:
# https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/playwright/browsers-and-os?fw-lang=nodejs
browserstack.playwrightVersion: 1.53.0 # must match our client playwright version in package.json
browserstack.playwrightLogs: false # disable playwright logs appearing on browserstack builds as may contain sensitive info like credentials
# CUSTOM_TAG_<INT>: # <string> (Default: parent folder name of the test file) Custom tag for your test suite
browserstack.maskBasicAuth: true # mask username and passwords from browserstack session logs
browserstack.maskCommands: sendType, sendPress, setHTTPCredentials, setStorageState, setWebAuthnCredentials # prevent sensitive info appearing in browserstack session logs
