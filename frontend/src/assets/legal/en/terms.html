By accessing or signing up to receive Communications, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
<p>Our Websites include multiple domains such as mozilla.org, mozillians.org, firefox.com, mozillafestival.org, openstandard.com, openbadges.org and webmaker.org. You may also recognize our Websites by nicknames such as Bugzilla@Mozilla, BMO, MozWiki, MoPad, MozReps, MDN, Marketplace, One and Done, SUMO, and AMO.
Some of our Websites connect you with links, apps or add-ons that are provided by other parties and are subject to separate Terms.</p>
<h4 id="2-account-registration">2. Account Registration</h4>
<p>Some Websites require you to register for an account in order to access additional features of a Website or another Mozilla service. If applicable, additional terms will be presented to you. You are responsible for all activities under your account.</p>
<p>Some Websites allow you to create a username during registration. Your use of a username must comply with our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/acceptable-use/">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. </p>
<h4 id="3-content-licensing">3. Content Licensing</h4>
<p>Our Communications include content such as articles, images, photographs, comments, software code, audio and video clips, and other materials (collectively, “Content”).  Content is authored by Mozilla, contributors to Mozilla projects, and other sources. </p>
<p>Content authored by Mozilla is generally made available for public sharing and reuse through open licenses such as Creative Commons (for expressive material) or the Mozilla Public License (for software code).  In most cases we ask Mozilla contributors to release Content under open licenses. </p>
<p>Some Content in our Communications is acquired from sources that prohibit further use of their Content without advance permission.  Where possible, the Content or Website footer will display a notice with the applicable license. You agree to abide by such notices.  Note the following specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some Content expressly indicates that the author does not intend for an open license to apply.  You should contact the author or author’s agent for permission to use such Content.  Questions on Mozilla authored content can be sent to: licensing@mozilla.org.</li>
<li>Some Content contains trademarks, trade dress, logos and brand assets of Mozilla and other parties (“Trademarks”).  Except for a few limited circumstances, Trademarks cannot be used without advance written permission of the owner of the Trademark.  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy/">Learn more on Mozilla trademarks.</a></li>
<li>Software used by our Websites is licensed under the MPL or similarly permissive open source licenses.  For more information on the specific license, please see the applicable source code or GitHub repository. </li>
</ul>

<li>You acknowledge that your Submissions may be accessible by other registered users of the applicable service or the public.</li>
<li>If your Submission contains expressive material or software code, you agree to license it in a manner that is compatible with the particular Website you are making a Submission to. </li>
<li>You represent and warrant that you have the rights necessary to grant the rights granted herein, and further, that the uses contemplated under these Terms will not infringe the proprietary or intellectual property rights of any third party.</li>
