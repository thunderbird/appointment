<h1><strong>Thunderbird Pro Services Privacy Notice</strong></h1>
<p>Last updated December 3, 2024</p>
<p>Thunderbird Services (the “Services”) are a collection of online services that integrate with Thunderbird and other applications to enable users to manage their communications, appointments, and files.</p>
<p>The Services are operated by MZLA Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation. These Mozilla entities are referred to in this Privacy Notice as “Thunderbird.”</p>
<p>This Privacy Notice explains what data Thunderbird collects and shares, and why. It is an addendum to the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/">Mozilla Privacy Policy</a> which, together with this Privacy Notice, governs how we receive, handle, and share information.</p>
<h2><strong>Thunderbird Collects Data To:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Authenticate you to the Services</strong></h3>
<p>To use the Services, you must register for a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/account/">Mozilla account</a>. When you log in to the Services using your Mozilla account, we store an authentication token associated with your login session. We retain this token until you log out, or your session expires.</p>
<p>Your Mozilla account information is stored separately, and that information is governed by the <a href="https://accounts.firefox.com/legal/privacy">Mozilla Accounts Privacy Notice</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Manage Calendar Appointments and Schedule Meetings</strong></h3>
<p>With Thunderbird Appointment, you can allow others to schedule appointments on your calendar.</p>
<p>You can connect your Google, Microsoft, or Apple calendar to Thunderbird Appointment to assist with scheduling.</p>
<h4>Calendars</h4>
<p>To use Appointment, you must connect one or more calendars:</p>
<ul>
<li>To connect a Google Calendar, you must login to Google to authorize Appointment to access your calendar data. We then store an OAuth authentication token that we use to retrieve data from your calendars.  </li>
<li>To connect a calendar on a CalDAV server, you must provide the server URL and your username and password for that server. We store these credentials in an encrypted database and use them to retrieve calendar data on your behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you connect a calendar to Appointment, we will receive basic information about your calendar invites such as the title, date, stated location, the name and emails of the attendees, and any text in the appointment. We use your calendar data to display your scheduled appointments to you, and to display your “free/busy” times (without any appointment details) to others to allow them to book appointments with you.</p>
<h4>Meetings</h4>
<p>You can connect your Zoom or Google Meet account to Appointments, to schedule meetings. To do this, you must login to your Zoom or Google account to authorize Appointment to access your account. We then store an OAuth authentication token that we use to retrieve data from your calendars.</p>
<p>Integration with these services enables Appointments to create meetings on your behalf and add them to your calendar. However, we do not collect any personal data from your account on Zoom or Google Meet.</p>
<h3><strong>Improve Performance, Stability, and Functionality For Our Users</strong></h3>
<p>We use third-party metrics and analytics services to enable us to make better decisions on which features should remain included or need to be changed, identify improvements for new features we implement, and find other ways to improve the Services for all our users. These service providers collect the following kinds of data on our behalf when you use our Services:</p>
<p><strong>Interaction data</strong>: Measurements about how you use the Services and how well they’re working.</p>
<p><strong>Technical data</strong>: Environment data from your device, such as browser version, hardware configuration, device operating system, and language preference. Our service providers receive your IP address, but we have configured these services not to store them.</p>
<h2><strong>Use of OAuth Information</strong></h2>
<p>OAuth is a secure authorization protocol that allows third-party applications to access resources without sharing login credentials. Thunderbird uses OAuth to connect with certain email or calendar providers that mandate or prefer its use, such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft. </p>
<p>When using OAuth to authorize access to your email or calendars, all data is strictly exchanged over an encrypted connection between your browser and the OAuth service. Thunderbird does not collect, access, or store any sensitive information exchanged during this process. When authentication is complete, we receive an OAuth token, which we store in an encrypted database so that we can access the account on your behalf. </p>
<h2><strong>Thunderbird May Disclose Information To:</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to the reasons stated in the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/">Mozilla Privacy Policy</a>, we may share your personal information with the following:</p>
<p><strong>Mozilla Affiliates</strong>: Thunderbird is a project of MZLA Technologies Corporation, a subsidiary of Mozilla Foundation and an affiliate of Mozilla Corporation, and as such, shares some of the same infrastructure. This means that, from time to time, your data (e.g., crash reports, and technical and interaction data) may be disclosed to Mozilla Corporation and Mozilla Foundation. If so, it will be maintained in accordance with the commitments we make in this Privacy Notice.</p>
