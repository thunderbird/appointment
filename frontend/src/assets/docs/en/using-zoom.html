<h1 id="using-zoom-with-thunderbird-appointment">Using Zoom with Thunderbird Appointment</h1>
<p>You can optionally connect your <a href="https://www.zoom.com/">Zoom</a> account to Thunderbird Appointment to generate one-time meeting links after a booking has been confirmed.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-your-zoom-account">Connecting your Zoom Account</h2>
<p>Connecting your Zoom account is simple! Once you're logged in, navigate to <a href="https://appointment.day/settings/connectedAccounts">Settings -&gt; Connected Accounts</a>. From there simply scroll down until you see the Zoom section. Click the <code>Connect</code> button, and you'll be sent over to Zoom's authentication flow and be asked to accept or deny permissions to Thunderbird Appointment. </p>
<p>If you accept the permissions you'll be sent back to Thunderbird Appointment where your account will be connected. You can confirm that you're good-to-go if you see a red <code>Disconnect</code> button instead of a <code>Connect</code> button. </p>
<h2 id="disconnecting-your-zoom-account">Disconnecting your Zoom Account</h2>
<p>If at any-time you want to disconnect your Zoom account you may do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the red <code>Disconnect</code> button on <a href="https://appointment.day/settings/connectedAccounts">Settings -&gt; Connected Accounts</a>.</li>
<li>In Zoom's settings you can remove authorization to Thunderbird Appointment.</li>
<li>You can delete your Thunderbird Appointment account.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any of these cases any references to your Zoom account will be removed from Thunderbird Appointment.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-meeting-link-generation">Enabling Meeting Link Generation</h2>
<p>Once you've connected your Zoom account you must enable meeting link generation on your schedule. </p>
<p>Simple navigate to <a href="https://appointment.day/dashboard">Dashboard</a> and click on the <code>Meeting Details</code> tab. Once expanded you should have access to check the <code>Generate Zoom Meeting</code> checkbox. Once checked you'll notice the <code>Video Link</code> section has been removed as Zoom meeting links will be generated at the time of booking. Finally, click the <code>Save</code> button below and you should be good to go!</p>
