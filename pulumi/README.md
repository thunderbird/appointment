 # AWS Python S3 Bucket Pulumi Template

 A minimal Pulumi template for provisioning a single AWS S3 bucket using Python.

 ## Overview

 This template provisions an S3 bucket (`pulumi_aws.s3.BucketV2`) in your AWS account and exports its ID as an output. It’s an ideal starting point when:
  - You want to learn Pulumi with AWS in Python.
  - You need a barebones S3 bucket deployment to build upon.
  - You prefer a minimal template without extra dependencies.

 ## Prerequisites

 - An AWS account with permissions to create S3 buckets.
 - AWS credentials configured in your environment (for example via AWS CLI or environment variables).
 - Python 3.6 or later installed.
 - Pulumi CLI already installed and logged in.

 ## Getting Started

 1. Generate a new project from this template:
    ```bash
    pulumi new aws-python
    ```
 2. Follow the prompts to set your project name and AWS region (default: `us-east-1`).
 3. Change into your project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <project-name>
    ```
 4. Preview the planned changes:
    ```bash
    pulumi preview
    ```
 5. Deploy the stack:
    ```bash
    pulumi up
    ```
 6. Tear down when finished:
    ```bash
    pulumi destroy
    ```

 ## Project Layout

 After running `pulumi new`, your directory will look like:
 ```
 ├── __main__.py         # Entry point of the Pulumi program
 ├── Pulumi.yaml         # Project metadata and template configuration
 ├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
 └── Pulumi.<stack>.yaml # Stack-specific configuration (e.g., Pulumi.dev.yaml)
 ```

 ## Configuration

 This template defines the following config value:

 - `aws:region` (string)
   The AWS region to deploy resources into.
   Default: `us-east-1`

 View or update configuration with:
 ```bash
 pulumi config get aws:region
 pulumi config set aws:region us-west-2
 ```

 ## Outputs

 Once deployed, the stack exports:

 - `bucket_name` — the ID of the created S3 bucket.

 Retrieve outputs with:
 ```bash
 pulumi stack output bucket_name
 ```

 ## Next Steps

 - Customize `__main__.py` to add or configure additional resources.
 - Explore the Pulumi AWS SDK: https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/
 - Break your infrastructure into modules for better organization.
 - Integrate into CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.
